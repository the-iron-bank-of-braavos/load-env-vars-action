In this repository you'll find a template to be used in you projects. This
template provided a complete set of files needed by the repositories, you can
find a full list just down below.

This is the template README file that must be modified to fit into your project.
Use this README as the stepping stone for your project's documentation and a
task list to review all the files needed to include in the project. All files
define a basic document structure and some introductory text to prevent you from
facing a blank page. This README file isn't an exception.

into your project's features:

* [ ] Review [README file](README.md)
* [ ] Review [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [ ] Review [contributing file](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [ ] Review issue [template for bugs](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)

* [ ] Review [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md)
